# PONGGL
An OpenGL implementation of the classic Pong game.
This implementation is done to learn about using OpenGL
and a multimedia library, such as freeglut and SDL.

On Windows compile with:
g++ -O2 pong.c -o pong -Wall -Wextra -lglut32 -lglu32 -lopengl32 -lm


TO DO:
There are a lot of improvements that can be done to this game. Examples are sounds, a vector2 class or some nice particle effects and shaders. Maybe even AI for a computer controlled enemy.
